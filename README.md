# Challenge 1: AlphaSense Case Study

## Overview and Origin
*This readme file is intended to adequately display some background information about the company AlphaSense, and research that outlines its strengths, competitive landscape, and potential future endeavors* 

**Name of company:** 
AlphaSense

**Incorporated:**
2011

**Founded by:**
Jack Kokko & Raj Neervannan

**Origin Story:**
Jack was a young investment banker responsible for finding insights on different markets and companies, and very often was having resort to *CTRL + F* in long documents to look for keywords in a very inefficient information gathering process. Many years later, he met Raj, who was from a similar background, and they discovered that these same challenges had not subsided, so they set out to change the industry

**Funding:**
* $770 Million to date 
* Privately funded by several investment firms, including JP Morgan Growth Equity Partners, Viking Global Investors, Alphabet’s growth fund CapitalG, and many more 

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
AlphaSene is trying to solve the fact that it’s extremely difficult to find relevant and concise information in the world investment world. A lot of time is spent trying to find, and then combing through information to find what may be a good or bad investment. 

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
AlphaSense primarily targets firms in the private capital markets space as their customer firms, but this could range far beyond that particular industry. This includes private equity firms, investment banks and family offices, but extends to wealth management firms, consultants, companies researching their competitors, and even individual investors. The global financial services market sits at $42 billion.


* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
AlphaSense’s competitive advantage lies within their ability to collect information from 10K+ reliable sources of information covering sector themes to 1 on 1 calls by industry experts. Competitors that have access to this much quality data are not able to summarize it nearly as comprehensively. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
AlphaSense utilizes AI, cloud computing, deep neural networks, and machine learning. They search terabytes of data through their open source platform called Apache Solr. The keys to their platform are that it’s able to do continuous search index rebalancing, dynamic scaling of the cloud cluster, and managing time series data by specific content sources.


## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
Enterprise Technology industry within Financial Data Services

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
The innovations in this field over the last 5-10 years all center around what AlphaSense does successfully. Companies have been trying to refine their ability to source the best information for their clients in the fastest and most concise way. As AI has improved over the last 5-10 year, the industry has quickly followed. 


* What are the other major companies in this field?
Factivia, Feedly, Koyfin, Bloomberg, Pitchbook, Crunchbase and Tegus

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Calculating the exact ROI of a tool like this is difficult, because it comes in tool consolidation, time savings, and a general increased capability to make better decisions. In general though, companies are able to easily locate and extract quantitative or structured information from unstructured content.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?
Measures of success for the company would be sales and market share, but since AlphaSense is private, we do not have access to this information or how they are doing compared to competitors. However, a site that reviews market intelligence company effectiveness, called G2, ranks it number one in the industry, which is a positive indicator.


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
I would suggest AlphaSense create an integration with a software that you can use to store key information from your searches in an organized way. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
As a customer, I would love to have access to all of this data and be able to quickly compare companies across an industry for instance. But if I’m doing this all day, it’s going to be easy to forget all of this information. I would like the ability to save key elements of the results and my evaluation. This could be an easy upsell that would benefit the customer’s organization, and AlphaSense’s sales. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
For this new offering, AlphaSense would need to have a database for their client and some additional software interface to allow the user to choose data points to save and add their own insights. 
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
This technology could integrate pretty seamlessly with a product built around structuring data.
